Volume Slicer
=============

The script volume_slicer.py generates images corresponding to slices of a block
specimen filled with ellipsoids. The ellipsoids have known properties such as
the volume fraction within the block, volumes of individual ellipsoids, a
length-to-width ratio and number.

Although some basic parameters can be set using the command line options, it is
preferable to describe the objects and generation rules in an input file - see
'examples/basic.py', where four classes of objects are defined.

Its purpose is to verify results, obtained by various software for
reconstructing 3D data (e.g. a living tissue microstructure) given a set of 2D
slices using usually stereological methods, on a dataset with well-defined and
known properties.

Dependencies:
-------------

numpy [1], scipy [1], matplotlib [2]

Those packages should be in your favourite Linux distribution. On Windows,
installing EPD [3] should get you running.

Command Line Usage:
-------------------

- Linux (POSIX systems):
  - print help:
    $ ./volume_slicer.py -h
  - run with default settings:
    $ ./volume_slicer.py
  - run example:
    $ ./volume_slicer.py examples/basic.py
  - run example, override some settings:
    $ ./volume_slicer.py examples/basic.py --resolution=100x100 --n-object=20 

- Windows:
  - print help:
    $ python volume_slicer.py -h
  - run with default settings:
    $ python volume_slicer.py
    or
    double click on the script
  - for other usage, see above (Linux)

The script can be run also inside ipython using the %run command.
