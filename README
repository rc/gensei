Volume Slicer
=============

The script volume_slicer.py generates images corresponding to slices of a block
specimen filled with ellipsoids. The ellipsoids have known properties such as
the volume fraction within the block, volumes of individual ellipsoids, a
length-to-width ratio and number.

Its purpose is to verify results, obtained by various software for
reconstructing 3D data (e.g. a living tissue microstructure) given a set of 2D
slices using usually stereological methods, on a dataset with well-defined and
known properties.
